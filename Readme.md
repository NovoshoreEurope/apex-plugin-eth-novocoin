## Ethereum Token Assignment Project

### Overview
In addition to the plugin, we have developed a project that showcases how ETH can be assigned to an Ethereum smart contract directly from an Oracle APEX application. This project demonstrates:
1. Integration of blockchain functionality into low-code environments like Oracle APEX.
2. Real-world use cases for deploying smart contracts and interacting with them via web interfaces.

## Tools Used

To develop and deploy this plugin locally or on testnets/mainnets, we used:

1. **Node.js (v14 or later)**  
   Essential for running development tools like Truffle and Ganache.

2. **Truffle Framework**  
   Provides a suite of tools for compiling contracts, deploying them on blockchains, and testing their functionality.

3. **Ganache**  
   Used as a local blockchain environment for testing smart contracts during development.

4. **MetaMask Wallet**  
   Enables wallet management and interaction with deployed contracts on Ethereum networks.
