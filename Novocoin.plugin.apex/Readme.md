# Novocoin APEX Plugin (Ethereum Sepolia)

Oracle APEX plugin to retrieve and display the Novocoin token balance for a given Ethereum address using the Sepolia testnet.

## 🧩 About This Plugin

This plugin is designed for developers working with Oracle APEX who want to integrate blockchain functionality—specifically, querying ERC-20 token balances from the Ethereum network—into their applications.

We created this plugin to simplify working with smart contracts, ABI files, and RPC nodes from within a traditional enterprise development environment like Oracle APEX.

## 🔧 How It Works

The plugin connects to the Ethereum Sepolia testnet and interacts with the Novocoin smart contract to retrieve the token balance for the address provided by the user.

- ✅ Queries ERC-20 token balances from the blockchain
- ✅ Displays balance inside an Oracle APEX region
- ✅ Built for the Sepolia testnet
- ✅ Uses JSON-RPC to communicate with an Ethereum node
- ✅ Fully encapsulated for easy APEX integration

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download and import the plugin** into your Oracle APEX app.
2. **Provide your Ethereum wallet address** in the plugin settings.
3. **Configure the plugin attributes**, including:
   - Ethereum RPC endpoint (e.g., https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your-key)
   - Novocoin contract address
   - ABI (included in the plugin)

## 🔐 Prerequisites

- Oracle APEX 22.1 or higher
- Access to an Ethereum RPC node (e.g., Infura or Alchemy)
- MetaMask wallet on Sepolia testnet (for testing)
- Novocoin test tokens (ERC-20 on Sepolia)

## 📜 Smart Contract Info

- **Token Name:** Novocoin (NOV)
- **Standard:** ERC-20
- **Network:** Sepolia
- **Contract Address:** `0x...` (TODO: Insert deployed contract address)
- **Decimals:** 3

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Oracle APEX (plugin development)
- JavaScript (for web3 integration)
- Ethereum JSON-RPC
- MetaMask for wallet connection
- Web3.js or Ethers.js (based on implementation)
